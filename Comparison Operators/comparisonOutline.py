This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

j = "cookies"
b = "yummy"

i = (j == b)
print(i)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

f = 4
o = 4

d = (f == o)
print(d)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

t = 4
s = 3

c = (t > s)
print(c)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

l = 2
m = 3

a = (l < m)
print(a)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y = 2
x = 3

g = (x >= y)
print(g)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

v = 5
x = 3

h = (x <= 7)
print(h)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

u = 5
p = 6

a = (u  6)
print(a)
