#Use input() to get the number of miles from the user. And store
#that int in a variable called miles.

miles = int(input("How many miles?"))


#Convert miles to yards, using the following:
# 1 mile = 1760 yards.

yards = miles * 1760

#Store the value in a variable called yards and print it out with a 
#simple statement.

print(str(miles) + " miles converts to " + str(yards) + " yards.")

#Convert miles to feet, using the following:
# 1 mile = 5280 feet.

feet = miles * 5280

#Store the value in a variable called feet and print it out with a 
#simple statement.

print(str(miles) + " miles converts to " + str(feet) + " feet.")

#Convert miles to inches, using the following:
# 1 mile = 63,360 inches.

inches = miles * 63360

#Store the value in a variable called inches and print it out with a 
#simple statement.

print(str(miles) + " miles converts to " + str(inches) + " inches.")
