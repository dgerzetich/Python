from pickle import TRUE

#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer
a = 5
print(a)

#Float
a = 3.45
print(a)

#String 
a = "Samantha"
print(a)

#Boolean
a = True
print(a)

#List
a = [1,2,3,4]
print(a)

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1
vara = 2
print(varA)
print(vara)

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

var = 4
var = "string"
print(var)

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

varTwo = varA
print(varTwo)

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

varz=42
l = [varA, varz, vara]
print(l[1])

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

string = "Daria"
D = "pickles"
print(string[0])

#7)
#Print out NE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(D)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
